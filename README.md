# PI-Game-Extension

A browser extension to play the PI Game.

The PI Game challenges users to recall and enter as many digits of the mathematical constant PI (3.14...) as possible. The extension provides an interactive interface for users to test and improve their memory of PI's digits.

## About the Extension

This browser extension allows users to play a simple game: enter as many correct digits of PI as possible, starting from 3.14. The extension checks each digit as you type and ends the game when a wrong digit is entered. Your highest score (number of correct digits) is tracked.

## How It Works

- The extension provides a popup interface where users can play the PI Game.
- Users type digits of PI one by one.
- The extension compares each input digit to the correct sequence of PI.
- The game ends when a wrong digit is entered, and the user's score is displayed.
- The extension is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and follows standard browser extension architecture (manifest file, popup UI, etc.).
